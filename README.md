## What is Cohort Analysis?

Cohort analysis is a behavioral analytics technique that groups customers by shared characteristics or experiences within a defined time span. In this analysis, we group customers by their **first purchase month** (acquisition cohort) and track their behavior over subsequent months.

### **Key Metrics Tracked:**
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers who return to make purchases
- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who stop purchasing (1 - Retention Rate)
- **Revenue per Customer**: Average revenue generated per customer over time
- **Period-over-Period Churn**: Monthly churn rates for each cohort

### **Why Cohort Analysis Matters:**
- **Identify customer lifecycle patterns**
- **Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
- **Optimize marketing and retention strategies**
- **Track product-market fit over time**
- **Compare performance across different customer segments**

## Methodology

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
```r
# Clean and filter data
retail_clean <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Customer ID`), 
         !is.na(InvoiceDate),
         Quantity > 0,
         Price > 0) %>%
  mutate(
    InvoiceDate = as.Date(InvoiceDate),
    Revenue = Quantity * Price,
    YearMonth = floor_date(InvoiceDate, "month")
  )
```

### **2. Cohort Definition**
- **Cohort**: Customers grouped by first purchase month
- **Cohort Month 0**: Initial purchase month (100% retention by definition)
- **Cohort Month N**: N months after first purchase

### **3. Analysis Framework**
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by acquisition month
2. **Retention Tracking**: Calculate monthly retention rates for each cohort
3. **Churn Analysis**: Measure customer loss patterns
4. **Revenue Analysis**: Track average revenue per user (ARPU) over time
5. **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns across cohorts


## Visualizations

Retention Heatmap: 

A heatmap showing the percentage of customers retained over time for each cohort, with green (100% retention) transitioning to red (low retention, e.g., 25%). The x-axis represents months since the first purchase, and the y-axis lists cohort periods (e.g., 2009-12 to 2010-12), with text labels indicating exact retention percentages.

Revenue Heatmap: 

A heatmap displaying the average revenue per customer in GBP, with orange shades indicating higher revenue (up to $800) and lighter shades showing lower revenue. The x-axis denotes months since the first purchase, and the y-axis lists cohort periods, with text labels showing revenue values.


Churn Heatmap (Cumulative):
A heatmap illustrating cumulative churn rates, with green (0% churn) transitioning to red (100% churn). The x-axis represents month numbers, the y-axis lists cohort first purchase months, and text labels display exact churn percentages.

Period-over-Period Churn Heatmap: 

A heatmap mapping churn rates between consecutive months, with green (negative churn, e.g., -27.3%) to red (high churn) color coding. The x-axis shows month numbers, the y-axis lists cohort periods, and text labels indicate period churn rates.


Churn Trend Line: 

A red line graph plotting the average churn rate across all cohorts over time, with dark red data points labeled by percentage (e.g., 77.8% at Month 1). The x-axis represents month numbers, and the y-axis shows the average churn rate.


Cohort Size Distribution:  

A bar chart with steel blue bars representing the number of customers per cohort, peaking at 955 in December 2009. The x-axis lists cohort months, the y-axis shows the number of customers, and text labels display exact counts.
